# Language

In order to construct a coherent worldview I first need an epistemological grounding, a first principle. I think the statement by Descartes <q>I think, therefore I am</q> is a fairly good starting point, because it seems that the perceptual experience of being conscious is epistemologically primary — as in, every means to knowledge is contingent on consciousness — every sense and every thought experienced is _through_ consciousness.

However, the statement <q>I think, therefore I am</q> actually suggests that this epistemological axiom is in fact not <q>being</q>, but rather <q>thinking</q>; the logic requires that thinking is primary because it proves being, and _**not**_ the other way around. The point I want to make in this article is that we think through language; and thus language precedes thought, and thus consciousness. With language I don't just mean language in the colloquial sense, but a descriptive system; the way we communicate (and think) is through representation, abstraction, relation and logic. For example you might say some people think without words — only in pictures — but even that is a language; a system consisting of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), though both can vary depending on the language. Besides the statement by Descartes logically requiring language to precede being, the very sentence itself is formulated _in_ language and thus seems to be contingent on language once again in a more meta way. Chris Langan's rendition of the idea I'm getting at describes this very well:

>Why is the universe a language? Basically, because any scientific or philosophical description of the universe is necessarily formulated in language, and the descriptive functionality of language implies that its content reflects the algebraic structure of language itself. Because every other intelligible descriptive structure, including every mathematical structure ever discovered, is formulated in terms of language, it is the most general and expressively powerful descriptive structure of all.

What I want to get across in short is that the underlying order of reality is always instantiated through language, and can be found in every structure and system, ranging all the way from our axiom of thinking (and thus consciousness) as described earlier, to the senses such as vision, to morality, to philosophic and scientific theories of the world.

The fact that you are thinking necessitates an ordering principle to the process of thinking, the fact that you have vision and can differentiate objects requires an ordering principle, the fact that we can describe the material world seemingly quite accurately using logic, mathematics and theories requires an ordering principle. Take even the most basic laws of physics, _what is a law_? It is an ordering principle, _it is a language_; a description of the workings of physics, and even if there were no humans to communicate this description, it would still be in place descriptively and thus in a sense linguistically. There ia common principle between the inside world of our minds, and the outside world, namely; language, law.

In order for anything to exist there has to be law, order, language, else it would just be incoherent chaos, or as Chris Langan calls it, _unbound telesis_. Aquinas had the similar conception of _māteriae prima_, a type of 'substance' that is totally unformed and indefinable, 'substance' totally devoid of _fōrma_; thus it being pure potency, only when this potency is actualized will it become definable. The Pythagoreans had the concept of the _dyad_ meaning <q>a pair</q> and is represented by the number two. The _dyad_ being the duality of _apeírōn_, meaning <q>infinite, boundless, indefinite</q>, and _péras_ meaning <q>finite, limit</q>. The Pythagorean “Two” representing disunion, the falling apart of the Absolute Devine Unity (represented by one), and is therefore the number that is connected with the world of creation, where everything is a creation of a combination the indefinite  — _apeírōn_, or  potency  — and _péras_  — that which defines, actualizes — or in our terminology of law and language, _legislates_.

In a reality without order, without physical, logical and metalogical laws — and on a deeper level, without form or essence, without act, without _péras_ — nothing coherent would be able to sustain and nothing definable would be able to exist. The Greek word _kósmos_ tells a similar story, its etymological meaning being <q>a production of order out of chaos</q>. Another interesting etymological fact about _kósmos_ is that the Proto-Indo-European root of the word means <q>to announce, proclaim</q>.


## Religion

In religion the concept of language being primary also seems to be very common, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God</q>, <q>And He taught Adam the names, all of them</q>, <q>And Our Word unto a thing, when We desire it, is only to say to it, “Be!” and it is</q>. The beforementioned idea of universal law, and ordering principle, also has its roots in religion:

+ _**Ṛta**_ - in Vedic religions, meaning <q>That which is ultimately responsible for the proper functioning of the natural, moral and sacrificial orders</q>, <q>fixed or settled order, rule, divine law or truth</q>. Like law or language, _ṛta_ can be found in various domains:

	>These different connotations are not contradictory but complementary in nature. Material sciences attempt to access ṛta from the perspective of the physical universe; the science of yajna is a similar pursuit from the perspective of religion; ṛta translated into social conduct is considered dharma; and the philosophical dimension of ṛta is called satya.

	And it seems that God is one with these ordering principles:

	>Creation is brought about through certain principles, although the Creator itself is beyond these principles. The fundamental principles underling this Creation, and also permeating it, are collectively called ṛta, which is one with the Divine.

	_Ṛta_ has quite an interesting etymology; it is related by its root to the Latin word _ōrdō_, meaning order, and it is even more closely related to the word _rite_. A rite is etymologically that which is accomplished in conformity with _order_, and which consequently imitates or reproduces at its own level the very process of manifestation; and that is why, in a strictly traditional civilization, every act of whatever kind takes on an essentially ritual character.

+ _**Tao**_  - in East Asian traditions, its etymological meaning being way or path. Laozi explains in the Tao Te Ching that <q>The Tao is not a “name” for a “thing” but the underlying natural order of the Universe</q>, and as with _ṛta_, we seem to be getting a non-dual conception of reality, <q>The Tao is a non-dualistic principle, it is the greater whole from which all the individual elements of the Universe derive</q>.

	Like _ṛta_, _tao_ has an interesting etymology, it might have its origin in the Indo-European root _dhorg_, meaning way or movement, the english words track and trail share the same origin. Even more unexpected than the panoply of Indo-European cognates for _tao_ is the Hebrew root _d-r-g_ for the same word, and the Arabic _t-r-q_, which yield words meaning <q>track, path, way, way of doing things</q> and is important in Islamic philosophical discourse, namely _ṭarīqah_, a Sufi order, the spiritual path to reach universal Truth, _Haqiqa_.

* _**Aša**_ - in Zoroastrianism, meaning <q>truth, right(eousness), order or right working</q>. The aforementioned _ṛta_ and _aša_ are both thought by some to derive from Proto-Indo-Iranian _hr̥tás_, truth.

* _**Logos**_ - in Christianity, meaning <q></q>

* _**Ḥaqīqa**_ or somehting

In short, this conception of language in law I have been speaking of, has a tradition precendence and is closely interweaved with the traditional conception of God, though I'm personally not yet sure if the common traditional conception is that of law emanating from God, or being ultimatly one with God.


## Conclusion

I don't know if I used _language_ in this article as really meaning a linguistic system, as Chris Langan seems to do, or more as a kind of analogy for _ṛta_, order, et cetera, which may or may not be completly describable linguistically. While writing this article I started out really being attracted to the former, but as I did more research (René Guénon's book _The Reign of Quantity & The Signs of the Times_ influencing me a lot) I came to see many similarities between the CTMU and Scholastic thought, _unbound telesis_ being _prime matter_, coherence being substance impregnated with form, and so on. Ultimatly there really is no cathartic conlcustion to this article, but it is rather written as a journey.
